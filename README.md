# GoogleSheetAPI
Project of google sheet api 
Task 1: Bootstrap, JS, Google Sheets API
                      
1. Create a simple webpage with two sections:
               a. Save: Create two input fields in it: Firstname and Lastname, and a Save button
               b. Fetch: Create one input field in it: Firstname, and a Fetch button
2. When the user clicks on the Save button in the Save section, the data entered by the user should get saved in a Google Sheet using their API.
The format of the sheet should be (example names are provided only for illustration):
Firstname      Lastname
John           Doe
Samantha       Collins
3. When the user enters a Firstname in the Fetch section, your code should fetch the corresponding Lastname from the same Google Sheet. The fetched Lastname should be printed on the webpage.
4. Imagine some scenarios in which the above system may fail and implement user-friendly solutions. Make reasonable assumptions wherever required.
